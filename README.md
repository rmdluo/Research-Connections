# Research-Connections
idea:
 - fetch papers from https://arxiv.org/help/api/index based on a search query
   - set a default max limit of 100 papers per query?
 - construct graph based on connections within a certain depth
 - maybe only keep edge between two people if it is greater than average number of shared papers
 - construct strongly connected components
